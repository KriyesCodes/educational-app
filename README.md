## Git Conventions

- git pull before using git push ALWAYS
- Git Branch Structure and Naming
  - There will be a "develop" branch which will be the currently working version of the project, which will be merged with the main live branch when needed. DO NOT merge anything directly with the develop or main branch, this will be done as a group during meetings.
  - Name branches according to the conventions defined here: https://medium.com/@abhay.pixolo/naming-conventions-for-git-branches-a-cheatsheet-8549feca2534
