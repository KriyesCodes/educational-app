## Conventions

### Git

- Git Branch Structure and Naming
  - There will be a "develop" branch which will be the currently working version of the project, which will be merged with the main live branch when needed. DO NOT merge anything directly with the develop or main branch.
  - Name branches according to the conventions defined at [Branch Naming](https://medium.com/@abhay.pixolo/naming-conventions-for-git-branches-a-cheatsheet-8549feca2534)

### Code

- Format code with tabs of 2 spaces (Use an vscode extension like Prettier for auto formatting on save)
- name HTML element IDs like javascript variable names (camelCase)
- For CSS, follow the [BEM](https://getbem.com/) naming convention
- [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp) conventions
